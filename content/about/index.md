Hello! I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering](https://www.dsce.edu.in/) where I completed my Bachelors in Information Science and Engineering (2017-2021).

I'm currently working as a developer for **Kaleyra** in the Core team. My responsibilties include developing & testing Golang based microservices.

My project [Voice Based Email for the Visually Impaired](https://github.com/viram-jain/VoiceBasedEmail) has been awarded the [Best Innovative Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKBYSgFlfV69KLNOmYR3QIo7Yyh82b7p/view?usp=sharing) by [Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering](https://www.dsce.edu.in/)

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
